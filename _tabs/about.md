In February, I successfully defended my PhD in Engineering Physics at the [Tegenfeldt lab](https://tegen.ftf.lth.se/) at Lund University, Sweden. I specialized in microfluidics, developing lab-on-a-chip platforms for speeding-up the pre-processing steps for genetic analysis as well as studying fundamental viscoelastic polymer phenomena to improve the pre-processing further. You can download my PhD thesis [here](https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/136526224/phdthesis_oskar_strom.pdf).

Some of the content will be published in my mother tongue, Swedish.
