This website is made in [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) (a static site generator) with the theme [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) (here is the [code](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)). The website is hosted for free on my GitHub repository. The website, its content and design is all conveniently updated through Git from my Visual Studio Code editor on my laptop. This aspects makes it very easy to copy and paste (re-start) the website if so needed. 

# Starting out
Follow the steps on this site: [https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/). This includes installing Jekyll and git as well as creating the new site with the Chirpy theme.
